    <body> <p>The Hawksbill Turtle is one of the smallest species of turtle. It is characterized by a narrow, pointed beak and a beautiful patterned shell, and it inhabits the warm, tropical coastline waters of the world’s oceans – from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific and Indian Ocean as well.
        It’s difficult to know precisely how many Hawksbill Turtles exist because but research suggests that there are only 5 populations world-wide, made up of around 8,000 turtles in total, and with only 1,000 females nesting annually.
        Turtles leave the sea to lay their eggs on the beach. They will choose a spot, dig a hole, lay their eggs, cover them up and return to the sea leaving their eggs behind. The eggs will remain buried for around 60 days until they hatch.

    <p>The olive ridley turtle is born with grey skin and a grey heart shaped shell (carapace) which turns an olive green once they reach adulthood. This is how they are given their name.
        They inhabit warmer oceans such as the Pacific, South Atlantic and Indian ocean.
        These sea turtles prefer to live in the ocean but females return to the beach they once hatched on to lay their eggs.</p>
