    <p>Kangaroos possess powerful hind legs, a long, strong tail, and small front legs. Kangaroos belong to the animal family Macropus, literally "big foot." Thanks to their large feet, kangaroos can leap some 30 feet (9 meters) in a single bound, and travel more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per hour.
    Kangaroos use their strong tails for balance while jumping. They are the tallest of all marsupials, standing over 6 feet tall.</p>

    <p>Generally, they are active at night and during periods of low light, but it is quite possible to find them out in the open in bright sunlight. During hot weather, kangaroos lick their forearms, which promotes heat loss by evaporation.
        With the removal of most of their natural predators, kangaroo populations have grown quite large.</p>

    <p> In the picture we have Grace the mom and her two badys Bandit and Rob.The lifespan in the wild for black-tailed prairie dogs is up to 8 years for females, and around 5 years for males. However, around half of prairie dogs in the wild do not survive their first year of life due to high rates of predation. Prairie dogs in human care can live over 8 years. spend most hot summer days sleeping and are active above ground in the morning and evening. In cool or overcast weather, prairie dogs may remain above ground all day. They emerge shortly after sunrise and return to the burrow around sunset. Rain will often drive them to retreat underground.</p>
