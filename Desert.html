<p style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow"> On the right we have a echidna Her name is Nick you probably never heard of them they are found many in Australia Echidnas are very solitary animals, but they are not territorial and are willing to share their home range with others of their kind.
    They are active during the day, but in warmer months they will often become nocturnal to avoid the heat. Echidnas have body temperatures of 89 degrees.</p>

<p style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow">These creatures have an extra-long claw on the second toe that they use to groom their spines. Both male and female echidnas have a pouch on the belly. Echidna can feel vibrations through their noses. An echidna has large, vertical slits just behind its eyes for ears. They also have extremely good hearing.</p>

When males come across each other, they might fight for dominance by trying to flip one another over. Males are larger than females and can be identified by curved horns on the lower shell, beneath the neck. </p>
