During mating season, female harp seals form large colonies on floating ice and give birth to young. Older seals return annually to pack ice to molt. They lose their pelts and top layers of skin and grow a new fur coat every year.
    Harp seals are sometimes called saddleback seals because of the dark, saddlelike marking on the back and sides of their light yellow or gray bodies of the adults.</p><q style="color: whitesmoke"> Fun facts are from:kids national geographic</q>

<p>Though Molly and Skyer are so aborable we have many other cute animals in the snow exhibit Like Ace here He is an amazing artic fox.</p>
